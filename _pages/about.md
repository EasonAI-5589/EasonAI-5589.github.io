# About Me

I am Yichen Guo, an AI researcher specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). I am currently pursuing my M.Eng in Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

## Education

**Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**
- M.Eng (by Research) in Computer Science and Engineering
- Sept. 2025 - Jun. 2026
- Focus: Large Language Model (LLM) and Large Vision-Language Model (LVLMs)

**University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**
- B.Eng. in Electronic Information Engineering
- Sept. 2021 - Jun. 2025
- GPA: 3.81/4.00; 85.95/100

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- **Model Efficiency**: Developing efficient inference methods for Large Vision-Language Models
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Reducing hallucinations in multimodal AI systems
- **Token Reduction**: Optimizing visual token processing for faster inference
- **Multimodal Learning**: Improving cross-modal understanding and reasoning

## Current Work

I am actively working on several research projects:

1. **STAR (Stage-wise Attention-Guided Token Reduction)**: A novel framework for efficient LVLM inference
2. **MAP (Map-Level Attention Processing)**: Mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs through semantic map processing
3. **DCLA (Dynamic Consistency Layer Aggregation)**: Improving semantic consistency in multimodal models
4. **FinePruner**: An optimized attention-score guided framework for pruning redundant visual tokens

## Professional Experience

**Data Scientist Intern** - Tencent LightSpeed Studios, Singapore (Aug. 2025 - Now)
- Construction of Multi-Agent Systems in Gaming Scenarios

**Computer Vision Algorithm Intern** - West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Jun. - Dec. 2024)
- Training Fundamental Vision Encoder for Clinical Scenarios with Self-Supervised Learning
