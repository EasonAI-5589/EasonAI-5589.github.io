# Welcome to My Research Journey

Hello and welcome to my personal research website! I'm Yichen Guo, an AI researcher specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).

## My Research Focus

My research primarily centers around two critical challenges in modern AI systems:

### 1. Model Efficiency
As Large Vision-Language Models become increasingly powerful, their computational requirements also grow exponentially. My work on **STAR (Stage-wise Attention-Guided Token Reduction)** addresses this challenge by developing efficient inference methods that can reduce computational overhead by up to 95% while maintaining or even improving performance.

### 2. Hallucination Mitigation
One of the most pressing issues in multimodal AI systems is the tendency to generate hallucinations - outputs that are factually incorrect or inconsistent with the input. My research on **MAP (Map-Level Attention Processing)** and **DCLA (Dynamic Consistency Layer Aggregation)** tackles this problem through novel attention mechanisms and consistency enforcement strategies.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on several exciting projects:

- **STAR**: A two-stage token reduction framework for efficient LVLM inference
- **MAP**: Map-level attention processing for hallucination mitigation
- **DCLA**: Inter-layer consistency aggregation for improved semantic coherence
- **SeeMe**: Visual token engineering for enhanced multimodal understanding

## Academic Journey

I'm currently pursuing my M.Eng in Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, with a focus on LLMs and LVLMs. Previously, I completed my B.Eng in Electronic Information Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) with a GPA of 3.81/4.00.

## Professional Experience

Beyond academia, I've gained valuable industry experience:
- **Data Scientist Intern** at Tencent LightSpeed Studios, working on multi-agent systems in gaming scenarios
- **Computer Vision Algorithm Intern** at West China Hospital, developing self-supervised learning methods for clinical applications

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to share my research journey, insights, and discoveries through this website. I'll be posting updates about my ongoing projects, research findings, and thoughts on the rapidly evolving field of AI.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have any questions about my work!
