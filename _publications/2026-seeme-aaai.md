We propose SeeMe, a novel approach for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through effective visual token engineering. SeeMe focuses on improving the quality and consistency of visual token processing to reduce hallucination phenomena in multimodal AI systems. The method demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination mitigation across various benchmarks while maintaining model performance and efficiency.
